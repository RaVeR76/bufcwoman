# **Ballymena United FC Women**

*Hero Image Here*

## **Goal for this project**

The main aim for this project is to display some information and contact details for my home towns local womans football team - **Ballymena United FC Women**.  
The website will be fairly simple where users can visit for relevant information associated with the club. 
This is all that is required at present and will possibly evolve in the future, depending on requirements.

This is my first solo project after completing my studies so I want to develop this website to the best of my ability.
I want to make my home town womans football team proud and encourage the girls or women of all ages to sign up, develop their skills and most importantly .... play some football !!!

I hope you enjoy this project :)

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration.  
I have went with the same combination for my first ever website as it was a one page scrolling site too and the fonts looked so good on the screen. 
The fonts are [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web) for the main text and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in Lato and the text is in Titillium Web .....

#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require.
I'm really not sure at this present time what icons will be used but deffo social media, email, phone and any other standard website icons will be used.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

#### Colours

I have used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to come up with my colour scheme for this project and I love this wee website, as it has amazing combinations
already there for developers to utilise them.
I used [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to select the exact colours that is used for the main club badge so I can use them throughout the site. 
The only one I am a little wary off is the Yellow Orange as it may not look too good on a webpage but I will see how it goes and if needs be, I will tweak it a little to make it work.

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

## **Wireframes**

The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fifth time I used this software and I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good and deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

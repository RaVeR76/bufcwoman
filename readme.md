## **Goal for this project**

The main aim for this project is to display some information and contact details for my home towns local womans football team - **Ballymena United FC Woman**.  
The website will be fairly simple where users can visit for relevant information associated with the club. 
This is all that is required at present and will possibly evolve in the future, depending on requirements.

This is my first solo project after completing my studies so I want to develop this website to the best of my ability.
I want to make my home town womans football team proud and encourage the girls or women of all ages to sign up, develop their skills and most importantly .... play some football !!!

I hope you enjoy this project :)

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require.
I'm really not sure at this present time what icons will be used but deffo social media, email, phone and any other standard website icons will be used.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

## **Wireframes**

The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fifth time I used this software and I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good and deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Goal for this project**

The main aim for this project is to display some information and contact details for my home towns local girls' and women's football team - **Ballymena United FC Women**.  
The website will be fairly simple where users can visit for relevant information associated with the club. 
This is all that is required at present and will possibly evolve in the future, depending on requirements.

This is my first solo project after completing my studies so I want to develop this website to the best of my ability.
I want to make my home town women's football team proud and encourage the girls or women of all ages to sign up, develop their skills and most importantly .... play some football !!!

I hope you enjoy this project :)

* A fairly simple one page site to display the basic information about the club
* A contact form that works safely and with no issues


### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration.  
I have went with the same combination for my first ever website as it was a one page scrolling site too and the fonts looked so good on the screen. 
The fonts are [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web) for the main text and [Roboto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Serif) for titles and section headings.


#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require.
I'm really not sure at this present time what icons will be used but deffo social media, email, phone and any other standard website icons will be used.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

#### Colours

I have used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to come up with my colour scheme for this project and I love this wee website, as it has amazing combinations
already there for developers to utilise them.
I used [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to select the exact colours that is used for the main club badge so I can use them throughout the site. 
The only one I am a little wary off is the Yellow Orange as it may not look too good on a webpage but I will see how it goes and if needs be, I will tweak it a little to make it work.

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

![BUFC Women Colours](https://github.com/RaVeR76/bufcwoman/raw/main/docs/screenshots/colour-scheme2.png)

So a better breakdown of the colours are shown below:

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***White***           |#FFFFFF    |White              |Body background, text & titles  |

## **Wireframes**

The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fifth time I used this software and I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good and deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Testing**
---

### Ease Of Use

#### User Story : I want to enjoy a aesthetically pleasing website which is easy to navigate around

* **Plan**  
Although this website was going to be fairly simple, I still wanted to create a uniqueness and eye catching experience within each section. 
I wanted each section to be just high enough for the screen and the scrolling behaviour to be smooth.

* **Implementation**  
My first step was a decent Navbar for the easy navigation purposes so I looked at the Bootstrap navbar and tried it to see. I had used this before on my wee course projects so knew it worked well. It looked okay but for me it just didn't have that ***Je Ne Sais Quoi*** that I desired. I searched for some cool Navbars and came across [this](https://codepen.io/albizan/pen/mMWdWZ) in Codepen from Albi. Now, I loved this on first sight and still do to be honest but I had to make a few wee changes to make it work with my website design. I changed the background colour to pure black when the user starts to scroll down. I love the fact the links are just sitting there at the top of my hero image then when you start to scroll the background appears. On the original the Nav links are lower then move up but I removed this as it made the link sit over one of the girls head. Realistically, the two girls should have space above them but I didn't take the hero image pics and this was the second time I had asked for some as the first weren't great quality. This was another lesson learnt to be fair as I had real annoyance trying to get the Hero Image to work but I think it turned out good in the end. I originally had the Clubs Crest as the navbar logo with *Ballymena United FC Women* added afterwards. When I added the Hero Image welcoming text it looked too much having this twice on the screen, so I removed it and added BUFC with the crest in the middle and women the other side. I think it looks really cool now and I remove the text when the screens get smaller leaving just the Crest as the Navbar logo. I also added the scrolling-behaviour as smooth, for a nice calm effect between sections.  
I extracted the main colours of the site from the club crest at the start of the project so I have tried my best to utilise these throughout the website which I think adds continunity. The navbar link hover colour is the crest blue, as is the social links and send button in the contact section which also change colour to the yellow orange when hovered over. The Hero welcome text has blue and white, the background has a yellow orange border which is also from the clubs crest (the wee towers). I also faded the background from white to blue in the Sponsors section too.

* **Test**   
As the website progressed I could see that making small changes to use the same colours worked well and kept unity. The smooth scrolling works well in Chrome, Firefox, Edge but it doesn't work in Safari .... it just jumps instantly to the selected section but it still looks and works well.
I also had a fixed background for the training section which worked really well across all platforms even Safari but it wouldn't work on IOS. On an Iphone the Training section  background was a zoomed in section of the image so was all pixelated and looked awful. That's why I was gutted as it looked so good on the rest of the devices, with the cards scrolling on past the fixed background but in the end there was no real easy fix so I just removed the ```background-attachment: fixed;```.
All navbar links work well and navigate the user to the chosen section of the website. The Sponsor links and the Contact social links all work well. 

* **Result**  
Overall, fairly happy with the small aesthetic adjustments. I was annoyed at the Training background issue but I still think it works well.

* **Verdict**  
Very happy with the overall look of the website. It displays the basic info and meets the requirements that was asked for, at the start of the project.



### What's It All About?

#### User Story : As a user I want to be able to visit the website and see what the football club is all about

* **Plan**  
The plan was simple .... add an About section giving a simple overview of the club.

* **Implementation**  
I asked Mark for some information about the club and he gave me a snippet from the Clubs Handbook. 
The hero image welcoming message was also at the start of the information he gave me.
I split the information up and added the welcome note to the Hero image just to add a little special touch on arrival.
The rest of the information is displayed on the left hand side of x-large screens whilst the Clubs Crest is displayed on the right.
As the screen gets smaller the clubs information moves on top of the clubs crest for large screens and when it gets to small tablet and mobile sizes, I remove the clubs crest altogether.
I added the Clubs Crest for larger screens because with just the information text, it looked boring and empty.
It has a faded background of White to Sky Blue but from left to right on larger screens and top to bottom on smaller screens, plus this would have a connection to the clubs kit colours as well. I didn't want to use the Clubs Crest blue here as the Crest is on display.

* **Test**   
I think this section works well and the information gets displayed as required. The Clubs Crest disappears on small tablet and mobile screens displaying just the information which works well. I reduce the font size as the screens get smaller to. I change the fade from 'left to right' to 'top to bottom' on small tablets and mobile screens because it looks much better.

* **Result**  
Overall, I am pleasantly pleased with the overall outcome and visual appearance. All we required was a little bit about the club to be there for a potential player to know about the club. Responsiveness works well too.

* **Verdict**  
Simple section which works well and tells the user a little bit about the club.


### Training Times

#### User Story : As a user I want see when training takes place and on what days

* **Plan**  
I hadn't anything special planned for this section beforehand other than somewhere to display training times and whatever day this happened.
I was basically sent an email with a few times Monday to Friday.

* **Implementation**  
My first instinct was to put these on cards some way, as just having them just on the screen seemed too boring and hard to fill the section.
I googled cool card displays and searched through some amazing sites until I came across the cards and animation credited in my README Credits. 
As you can see the cards look completely different but perform the same animation. Obviously I didn't want cats on a football themed website ha ha so I removed the images. I tried adding my own football images which I have to say some looked really awesome, I actually saved the code to some of the cards I designed that I didn't use, for possible future projects. These just didn't fit the section and when I found the *training times* background image in Unsplash, I knew instantly that this was going to be the background. I added some white to blue fade across it to try keep within the websites colour scheme and I think it works quite well. The original image works well too but I just thought the darkness of it was too much of a contrast change when moving from the *About* section to the *Sponsors* section.  
So back to the cards as I had now designed the background of the section. Like I said above, I stripped the cards back and added the basic info required. No cat images on the front, only the age group for that card. When you hover over the card, the age display moves up and training times appears where both fonts turn green. I tried the blue from the navbar here but I think the green looks cool. To be honest this green colour was the original colour I got with the navbar code but I changed it to the Crest Blue as it keeps within the theme better.   
Once the user selects the age group the card flips over to display the day & time / times for the chosen age group. The animation for the flipping of the cards only allows one card to be flipped at once and when another card is selected they both flip in opposite directions which I think makes the card flip animation so cool. I did have some responsive and font issues getting this section correct but I think it looks class.

* **Test**   
The training times and days are displayed for each age group. Obviously, the user needs to flip the card to see ha ha. When you hover over the card a little animation makes it look even better. When the card is selected it flips over 180 degrees to display the day and time. If the user selects another card both flip over leaving the selected card times displayed.

* **Result**  
Overall, I think the background image along with the card design and the card animations, this section looks awesome. I would say it's my favourite along with the contact section but they all look cool too.

* **Verdict**  
This section works well within the overall feel of the website and what the section is about. The background image is girls training at night under the floodlights which I blued a wee bit lol, and the individual age training times get displayed in a nice interactive way for the user. It kind of reminds me of a Card version of amazing desk toy Newtons Craddle :)


### Contact

#### User Story : As a user I want to be able to contact the club by email or phone

* **Plan**  
I wanted a simple but effective contact section where a user can get in contact with the club to show interest in playing or simply ask a question.
I was going to add address information, all the individual age group coaches phone numbers and their names but we decided against this as the coaches use their personal phones and we didn't want these online. To be honest, I forgot that the coaches are volunteers and are using their own time to invest in the young ones so obviously they don't want their personal details out there for everyone to see.  
The club had an old website built through [Pitchero](https://www.pitchero.com/) which was under their old team name, Ballymena United Allstars, but it's never updated so I had a look at this to see what contact connections their were available. Their social account links didn't work due to the fact that the accounts were now no longer in use due to the name change. I searched the About section on their Facebook page and found the email address, Twitter account and Messenger account too so that was a good start.

* **Implementation**  
Firstly I trawled the internet for some cool contact forms and I have to say there are some very clever and beautifully designed Contact Form out there. 
I tried a few out first before I found .... THE ONE !!! I didn't realise you could search [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) for Contact Forms or anything like that, I had only used it for testing small snippets of code myself or when clicking on another coders explanation of an issue I had.  
Anyways, I did a search within Codepen and came up with some awesome Contact Forms [here](https://codepen.io/tag/contact-form). You can see that the one I utilised is on the first page ha ha but I did search through the various pages and try a few others first before I settled on the one by Alina. I tweaked the code a little changing the social icons using Font Awesome instead of web image links, adding the proper social / email links and changing styles to suit. I used the Club Crest blue again with the icons white and the clubs orange with icons black when hovering. I did this for the send button too, to keep the continunity across this section. I also had the background blue as it was in the original code by Alina. Personally I though this was too bland for this section as the previous section the Sponsors section had a plain background at that time. I knew I had downloaded a few free football related images from Unsplash so tried the Adidas football on the grass image for the background and I swear .... I couldn't believe how much it changed this section. It worked so well with the contact form, the various dark blues in the Contact social side of the form blended in with the image sky blueness, not sure if this is a word but you know what I mean lol. The ball is positioned behind the form on all screen sizes, with the transparancy of the message side allowing it to show through for that added wee touch. 

* **Test**  
During design phase I used [Formsubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) to test the functionality of my Contact Form message inputs. This worked very well and allowed me to test that the inputs and everything was functioning as it should. Once I had finished the website I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy it and then I utilised their built in form handling to look after any forms sent. Once I read the documentation and added the required Netlify code to my form, it was good to test. It worked very well and I was able to see the messages in my Netlify account. I then linked my personal email so that each send message would be sent onto this as I knew this would be the way I would set up the Clubs email address for receiving the messages. Again, it all worked perfectly and I was super pleased with the testing of the messages. I even added the Netlify **HoneyPot** code which allows me to add a hidden input field which a **BOT** will not know is hidden and proceed to fill out. This will be picked up by Netlify who will block and disregard this message and therefore protect the website from spam bots.  
As regards the social links and email, when you hover over the icon it turns orange and when the user clicks on the icon it will take them to the required page on another tab. The email will open the users default email method and pre-populate the **To:** input with the clubs email address.

* **Result**  
All the various testing above passed and the Contact form works really well. It has all the requirements for contacting the club, that are available, on display and functioning well. 

* **Verdict**  
Super happy with how this turned out and it looks amazing in my opinion :) The Clubs colours are there and change on hover for a nice added touch. It's responsive too and looks well across all platforms. It's deffo up there with the Training Time section as my favourite sections of the website.



### Club Sponsors

#### User Story : As a user I want to know who the sponsors are, that support the club

* **Plan**  
The club have three main sponsors so I needed a section were I could display these and add links to their associated websites or Facebook page. I didn't need anything to extravigant for this section so I kept it simple and to the point.

* **Implementation**  
Mark had given me the Sponsors logos in *PNG* format so that was a great start. I knew I was going to use Bootstrap 5 cards for these as I had used these on my last Course project, [The Kicks Fix](https://raver76-the-kicks-fix.herokuapp.com/), for displaying kick images and info. Only I didn't require any info just the Sponsor logos but needed to add the links etc. The logos were all different sizes so I needed to edit these to get them all to the same size for *unity* purposes. Once I completed this then I just added the Bootstrap card code and tweaked to suit. I added a little CSS to make the Sponsor cards **jump out** so to speak when the user hovers over the card. I added a border and some shadow for better effects and I think it all works well. I added a linear-gradient of the colour white to again the Clubs Crest colour blue (two of my selected colours at the start of planning). I also added a backup background colour of Sky Blue, in case *linear-gradient* doesn't work on some platforms.

* **Test**  
Not much to test here as it's a fairly basic section. The cards get larger by 10% when hovered over and when the card is clicked on, the Sponsors website or Facebook page open on a different tab within the users browser.

* **Result**  
This section works well and displays the Clubs Sponsors so the user knows who invests in the club.  

* **Verdict**  
Although this section may not have exoticness of the Training Times or Contact sections, I am still really happy with the overall look & feel of it.



### Facebook Link

#### User Story : As a user I want to be able to connect to the clubs Facebook page

* **Plan**  
I was originally just going to have a Facebook link along with maybe some other club associated links within a footer but when I found that Contact Form, I knew I could add it here. As a coder sometimes your original plans change but generally for the better as so in this case. I love the Contact form so much as it covers everything for the Club.

* **Implementation**  
Added to the Contact forms Social section along with various other connections.

* **Test**  
Facebook icon looks well, as do the others, and link connects the user to the Clubs Facebook page.

* **Result**  
The icon changes colour on hover for a lovely effect and the link works.

* **Verdict**  
The user can connect to the Clubs Facebook page with one click so happy with that.





### **Validation Checks**

All my HTML passed all the checks at [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) with only a few errors which were related to having p elements inside a span for my hero page welcome text and one warning because I wasn't using a header in my hero section.  
Below is my code before validation alerted me to the issues.

Below is all the errors my HTML validation threw up.  
![HTML Validation Results](https://github.com/RaVeR76/bufcwoman/raw/main/docs/screenshots/html-val-errors.png)  

I then did a few code changes to eliminate these errors. Below is my code after I fixed the validation issues.

## **Bugs**
---

### **About Text Looks So Narrow On Smaller Screens**

* **Bug**  
The About Section text was very narrow and squeezed, on the smaller mobile screen views.

* **Fix**  
I added Bootstrap responsive padding at certain breakpoints to cover this issue.

* **Verdict**  
I needed padding for medium to xx-large size screens to make it look good but no padding on screen sizes below medium.
I think the Bootstrap responsive padding works well. I tried just adding responsive zero padding for small and extra small screen sizes but this made all screen sizes have zero padding which is why I had to use ```p-xxl-5 p-xl-5 p-lg-5 p-md-5``` and leave the smaller ones out.
Overall though it works the way I wanted it to so I am happy.


### **Contact Form Responsiveness**

* **Bug**  
When I first tried using this Contact Form code I didn't add the media queries as I wanted to use the Bootstrap grid. I seperated the the two Contact Form sections into columns and used Bootstrap to align them together. It all looked good on larger screens but as the screen size got smaller the two columns kept overlapping and I could not figure out why. I tried and I tried again ha ha, various different Bootstrap methods to get this Contact Form to work but in the end I had to give up, I had already wasted so much time trying to get this to work unfortunately. 

* **Fix**  
I deleted the Contact Form code I was trying and started again, using the media queries that came with the original code but only I used my media query setpoints instead of the original. 

* **Verdict**  
After the pain of trying to make this work using the Bootstrap grid, columns and breakpoints then resorting back to the original code and media queries. I am super happy with the Contact section and it's responsiveness across all screen sizes.


### **Firefox Training Section Flip Cards Not Working Properly**  

* **Bug**  
In the Firefox browser and within the training section, the flipped cards were showing the front face overlapping the flipped over backface which obviously wasn't going to work. I had a similar problem with one of my Course projects on the Safari browser so I had a fair idea what the issue was.

* **Fix**  
I tried adding the ```-moz-``` prefix but it changed nothing. I read online that it used to work on previous versions but on the newer ones, it has stopped working again. Anyway, I added ```transform: rotateX(0deg);``` to the *face class* which I sourced [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9604982/backface-visibility-not-working-properly-in-firefox-works-in-safari) and that sorted it.

* **Verdict**  
This was the only bug for Mozilla Firefox so I was very happy to find the solution and it works the same as all browsers now.


### **Fixed Background Image Not Working On iOS**

* **Bug**  
While I had my wee website looking beautiful on my Windows laptop and my Android mobile, both using Google Chrome, not all was as beautiful when testing on other browsers ha ha but this what makes you a better coder tbh. For my Training Section I had a the image fixed so when you scrolled down past it, it didn't move but the cards and all did. This feature I loved and it really added to my website plus I think it looks super cool.
Unfortunately, I had no Apple products whatsoever so testing was really hard for me in this situation. I had to get my sister to bring her iPhone and my brother to bring his Macbook so I could see how the website looked, which was a pain in the butt to be honest but had to be done.  
The Training Times section looked good on the Macbook with the image fixed but on the iPhone the image was fixed okay but it was like a small zoomed in part of the overall image and very pixelated. This definitely would **NOT** do as it looked so bad !

* **Fix**  
I searched the internet but could find no real easy way to fix this bug. There were apparent solutions which I tried but none of them worked. There were loads of similar questions and a lot of dismayed coders out there, that Apple have not fixed this on iOS but it works on Macs. In the end I had to give up and just remove the ```background-attachment: fixed;``` from the Training Times background image. This still gave me a small headache as the image was still a little *zoomed in* on small and extra small screen sizes compared to medium and anything larger. Again, I tried to look for a fix for this but there was none. Don't get me wrong it still looks okay as I made sure the girl in the training image was in the center for smaller screens.

* **Verdict**  
Super disappointed that I had to remove this as I think it's an amazing effect that adds to your website but I couldn't have iPhone users thinking .... what the fxck is that in the background. Hopefully, the geniuses at Apple can add this to their iOS Safari version at some point in the future and then I will go back and add it again.


### **No Scrolling In Safari**

* **Bug**  
When testing my website within the Safari browser on both Mac and iPhones, I noticed that the smooth scrolling effect when you click a link on the Navbar was not working. When the user clicks on a navbar link, the chosen section just appears without any scrolling whatsoever !
I've just noticed during writing this up that whilst the scrolling effect works in Firefox and Edge .... they are not scrolling **smoothly** like in Chrome so I'll have to look into this at a later date.

* **Fix**  
There is no fix or at least I could not find one anywhere

* **Verdict**  
Whilst the scrolling effect not working in Safari doesn't really change how the overall website looks, it's still a nice feature to have.


### **Navbar List Font Too Large On Small Landscape Views**

* **Bug**  
When I looked at the Navbar list on smaller screens but in landscape view, the font size was too large and the bootom links disappeared off the bottom of the screen. There was no way of accessing the lower links as they were off the screen.

* **Fix**  
I made the font smaller, from 3rem to 2.5rem and I also added an auto scroll too for extra security.

* **Verdict**  
It's so hard to find solutions for all screen sizes on either orientation. Whilst the website looks awesome on larger screens for landscape, on smaller screens it may look a little larger than usual but it's more suited to portrait mode on smaller devices. Again, I will deffo put this down to experince on my behalf as I often struggle with this but I believe I am getting better.  
Anyway, the bug was fixed for this issue and I am happy with the outcome.


### **Don't Test Using An Old iPad**

* **Bug**  
Unfortunately, I own no Apple products whatsoever so testing was really hard for me in this situation. I knew my mum had an old iPad (iPad2) that she never used so I asked her for it and factory reset it so I could set it up for myself. Once I got through this then I was able to look at my website and I near crapped myself at all the issues. The Home text opacity was zero and transparent, the Sponsor section background colours weren't displaying, the Contact Form message side background was transparent and the Contact Form font was super small. I was like .... NO WAY so before I dived in and started to fix these I gave my sister a call and asked her to drop in on way home from work the next day with her iPhone. The issues mentioned were okay on her iPhone so I am assuming it was because my mums iPad was so old (iPad2) and had a outdated Safari version on it. I was a lot happier when I seen the website on my sister iPhone ha ha.

* **Fix**  
No fixes required here, just a change of underwear :)

* **Verdict**  
I may need to invest in some Apple products so that I have method of testing code, without hassling my big sis and big bro !

## **Deployment**
---
### Local Deployment

This was my first time using Virtual Studio Code to develop a website so it took me a little while to get it set up and to get used to things .... I'm still learning, to be honest.  
I used **Live-Server** for local testing so I could see any changes I made work instantly. It automatically refreshes too on every save which is a cool feature.  
I haven't really explored VS Code in depth yet so hopefully that will come over time and experience.


### Live Deployment 

As this was my first proper website, so to speak, I needed to find a decent hosting platform.
I did some research and asked fellow coders on Slack. There were a few static website hosting platforms that stood out but after comparing the various ones against my needs, I settled for Netlify.
It's so straight forward to use and the help documentation available is unreal - **[Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/)**
There is no point me duplicating what is in the documentation as it's really that easy to understand.

I set up deployment through my Github account which is linked to my VS Code so everything runs smoothly.

I even linked the domain name which I had bought on Google at the start of the project.

You can utilise Netlifys Forms functions for form control and spam protection.

Overall, I'm very pleased with Netlify as my hosting platform and will deffo use it for future static websites.

I had one last issue where the website was not appearing in Google searches. After more research I realised that although I had registered the name with Google I needed to add a sitemap. I know this is basically only a one page website for displaying information and a contact form but I deffo think it helped by adding a sitemap to Google. I also asked Google to index the page so it now says that the URL is on Google.


## **Conclusion**
---

I really enjoyed designing and building this unique website for my local wee womens football team. I learned a serious amount as regards deployment on a proper hosting platform, Google searching techniques, I was on my own with this one and personally I think it turned out well. I know it's fairly simple but it's unique and I'm proud of it to be honest.

I encountered a few bugs as mentioned above. The hero image cause me a lot of pain to be fair. As I wasn't in control of the images I had to use what I got given. First batch was on a mobile phone so weren't that great. The second batch were proper image material but I had issues with the lightness as they were taken at night. The floodlights along the back really messed with my navbar so I had to use a blurring app to blur them out. They were too bright so over powered my nav links. I still think it works quite well overall.

Think my next project has to be a portfolio so I can sell myself a bit better and stop being a dreamer :)

## **Goal for this project**

The main aim for this project is to display some information and contact details for my home towns local girls' and women's football team - **Ballymena United FC Women**.  
The website will be fairly simple where users can visit for relevant information associated with the club. 
This is all that is required at present and will possibly evolve in the future, depending on requirements.

This is my first solo project after completing my studies so I want to develop this website to the best of my ability.
I want to make my home town women's football team proud and encourage the girls or women of all ages to sign up, develop their skills and most importantly .... play some football !!!

I hope you enjoy this project :)

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration.  
I have went with the same combination for my first ever website as it was a one page scrolling site too and the fonts looked so good on the screen. 
The fonts are [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web) for the main text and [Roboto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Serif) for titles and section headings.


#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require.
I'm really not sure at this present time what icons will be used but deffo social media, email, phone and any other standard website icons will be used.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

#### Colours

I have used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to come up with my colour scheme for this project and I love this wee website, as it has amazing combinations
already there for developers to utilise them.
I used [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to select the exact colours that is used for the main club badge so I can use them throughout the site. 
The only one I am a little wary off is the Yellow Orange as it may not look too good on a webpage but I will see how it goes and if needs be, I will tweak it a little to make it work.

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

So a better breakdown of the colours are shown below:

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***White***           |#FFFFFF    |White              |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Cyan Process***    |#26a9e0    |Sky Blue           |Body background                 |
|***Yellow Orange***   |#faaf3f    |Light Orange       |Body background                 |
|***Black***           |#000000    |Black              |Body background, text & titles  |



## **Wireframes**

The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fifth time I used this software and I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good and deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Testing**

### Ease Of Use

#### User Story : I want to enjoy a aesthetically pleasing website which is easy to navigate around

* **Plan**  
Although this website was going to be fairly simple, I still wanted to create a uniqueness and eye catching experience within each section. 
I wanted each section to be just high enough for the screen and the scrolling behaviour to be smooth.

* **Implementation**  
I extracted the main colours of the site from the club crest at the start of the project so I have tried my best to utilise these throughout the website which I think adds continunity. The navbar link hover colour is the crest blue, as is the social links and send button in the contact section which also change colour to the yellow orange when hovered over. The Hero welcome text has blue and white, the background has a yellow orange border which is also from the clubs crest (the wee towers). I also faded the background from white to blue in the Sponsors section too.

* **Test**   
As the website progressed I could see that making small changes to use the same colours worked well and kept unity. The smooth scrolling works well in Chrome, Firefox, Edge but it doesn't work in Safari .... it just jumps instantly to the selected section but it still looks and works well.
I also had a fixed background for the training section which worked really well across all platforms even Safari but it wouldn't work on Ios. On an Iphone the Training section  background was a zoomed in section of the image so was all pixelated and looked awful. That's why I was gutted as it looked so good on the rest of the devices, with the cards scrolling on past the fixed background but in the end there was no real easy fix so I just removed the ```background-attachment: fixed;```.
All links work well and navigate the user to the chosen section of the website. The Sponsor links and the Contact social links all work well. 

* **Result**  
Overall, fairly happy with the small aesthetic adjustments. I was annoyed at the Training background issue but I still think it works well.

* **Verdict**
Very happy with the overall look of the website. It displays the basic info and meets the requirements that was asked for, at the start of the project.



### What's It All About?

#### User Story : As a user I want to be able to visit the website and see what the football club is all about

* **Plan**  
The plan was simple .... add an About section giving a simple overview of the club.

* **Implementation**  
I asked Mark for some information about the club and he gave me a snippet from the Clubs Handbook. 
The hero image welcoming message was also at the start of the information he gave me.
I split the information up and added the welcome note to the Hero image just to add a little special touch on arrival.
The rest of the information is displayed on the left hand side of x-large screens whilst the Clubs Crest is displayed on the right.
As the screen gets smaller the clubs information moves on top of the clubs crest for large screens and when it gets to small tablet and mobile sizes, I remove the clubs crest altogether.
I added the Clubs Crest for larger screens because with just the information text, it looked boring and empty.
It is a faded background of White to Sky Blue, as this would have a connection to the clubs kit colours as well. I didn't want to use the Clubs Crest blue here as the Crest is on display.

* **Test**   
I think this section works well and the information gets displayed as required. The Clubs Crest disappears on small tablet and mobile screens displaying just the information which works well. I reduce the font size as the screens get smaller to. I change the fade from 'left to right' to 'top to bottom' on small tablets and mobile screens because it looks much better.

* **Result**
Overall, I am pleasantly pleased with the overall outcome and visual appearance. All we required was a little bit about the club to be there for a potential player to know about the club. Responsiveness works well too.

* **Verdict**
Simple section which works well and tells the user a little bit about the club.


### Training Times

#### User Story : As a user I want see when training takes place and on what days

* **Plan**  
I hadn't anything special planned for this section beforehand other than somewhere to display training times and whatever day this happened.
I was basically given a email with a few times Monday to Friday.

* **Implementation**  
My first instinct was to put these on cards some way, as just having them just on the screen seemed too boring and hard to fill the section.
I googled cool card displays and searched through some amazing sites until I came across the cards and animation credited in my README Credits. 
As you can see the cards look completely different but perform the same animation. Obviously I didn't want cats on a football themed website ha ha so I removed the images. I tried adding my own football images which I have to say some looked really awesome, I actually saved the code to some of the cards I designed that I didn't use, for possible future projects. These just didn't fit the section and when I found the *training times* background image in Unsplash, I knew instantly that this was going to be the background. I added some white to blue fade across it to try keep within the websites colour scheme and I think it works quite well. The original image works well too but I just thought the darkness of it was too much of a contrast change when moving from the *About* section to the *Sponsors* section.  
So back to the cards as I had now designed the background of the section. Like I said above, I stripped the cards back and added the basic info required. No cat images on the front, only the age group for that card. When you hover over the card, the age display moves up and training times appears where both fonts turn green. I tried the blue form the navbar here but I thuink the green looks cool. To be honest this green colour was the original colour I got with the navbar code but I changed it to the Crest Blue as it keeps within the theme better.   
Once the user selects the age group the card flips over to display the day & time / times for the chosen age group. The animation for the flipping of the cards only allows one card to be flipped at once and when another card is selected they both flip in opposite directions which I think makes the card flip animation so cool. I did have some responsive and font issues getting this section correct but I thunk it looks class.

* **Test**   
The training times and days are displayed for each age group. Obviously, the user needs to flip the card to see ha ha. When you hover over the card a little animation makes it look even better. When the card is selected it flips over 180 degrees to display the day and time. If the user selects another card both flip over leaving the selected card times displayed.

* **Result**  
Overall, I think the background image along with the card design and the card animations, this section looks awesome. I would say it's my favorite along with the contact section but they all look cool too.

* **Verdict**
This section works well within the overall feel of the website and what the section is about. The background image is girls training at night under the floodlights which I blued a wee bit lol, and the individual age training times get displayed in a nice interactive way for the user. It kind of reminds me of a Card version of amazing desk toy Newtons Craddle :)


### Contact

#### User Story : As a user I want to be able to contact the club by email or phone

* **Plan**  
I wanted a simple but effective contact section where a user can get in contact with the club to show interest in playing or simply ask a question.
I was going to add address information, all the individual age group coaches phone numbers and their names but we decided against this as the coaches use their personal phones and we didn't want these online. To be honest, I forgot that the coaches are volunteers and are using their own time to invest in the young ones so obviously they don't want their personal details out there for everyone to see.  
The club had an old website built through [Pitchero](https://www.pitchero.com/) which was under their old team name, Ballymena United Allstars, but it's never updated so I had a look at this to see what contact connections their were available. Their social account links didn't work due to the fact that the accounts were now no longer in use due to the name change. I searched the About section on their Facebook page and found the email address, Twitter account and Messenger account too so that was a good start.

* **Implementation**  
Firstly I trawled the internet for some cool contact forms and I have to say there are some very clever and beautifully designed Contact Form out there. 
I tried a few out first before I found .... THE ONE !!! I didn't realise you could search [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) for Contact Forms or anything like that, I had only used it for testing small snippets of code myself or when clicking on another coders explanation of an issue I had.  
Anyways, I did a search within Codepen and came up with some awesome Contact Forms [here](https://codepen.io/tag/contact-form). You can see that the one I utilised is on the first page ha ha but I did search through the various pages and try a few others first before I settled on the one by Alina. I tweaked the code a little changing the social icons using Font Awesome instead of web image links, adding the proper social links and changing styles to suit. I used the Club Crest blue again with the icons white and the clubs orange with icons black when hovering. I did this for the send button too, to keep the continunity across this section. I also had the background blue as it was in the original code by Alina. Personally I though this was too bland for this section as the previous section the Sponsors section had a plain background at that time. I knew I had downloaded a few free football related images from Unsplash so tried the Adidas football on the grass image for the background and I swear .... I couldn't believe how much it changed this section. It worked so well with the contact form, the various dark blues in the Contact social side of the form blended in with the image sky blueness, not sure if this is a word but you know what I mean lol. The ball is positioned behind the form on all screen sizes, with the transparancy of the message side allowing it to show through for that added wee touch. 

* **Test**  
During design phase I used [Formsubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) to test the functionality of my Contact Form message inputs. This worked very well and allowed me to test that the inputs and everything was functioning as it should. Once I had finished the website I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy it and then I utilised their built in form handling to look after any forms. Once I read the documentation and added the required Netlify code to my form, it was good to test. It worked very well and I was able to see the messages in my Netlify account. I then linked my personal email so that each send message would be sent onto this as I knew this would be the way I would set up the Clubs email address for receiving the messages. Again, it all worked perfectly and I was super pleased with the testing of the messages. I even added the Netlify **HoneyPot** code which allows me to add a hidden input field which a **BOT** will not know is hidden and proceed to fill out. This will be picked up by Netlify who will block and disregard this message and therefore protect the website from spam bots. 

* **Result**  

* **Verdict**

### **Validation Checks**

All my HTML passed all the checks at [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) with only a few errors which were related to having p elements inside a span for my hero page welcome text and one warning because I wasn't using a header in my hero section.  
Below is my code before validation alerted me to the issues.

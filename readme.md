## **Goal for this project**

The main aim for this project is to display some information and contact details for my home towns local womans football team - **Ballymena United FC Women**.  
The website will be fairly simple where users can visit for relevant information associated with the club. 
This is all that is required at present and will possibly evolve in the future, depending on requirements.

This is my first solo project after completing my studies so I want to develop this website to the best of my ability.
I want to make my home town womans football team proud and encourage the girls or women of all ages to sign up, develop their skills and most importantly .... play some football !!!

I hope you enjoy this project :)

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration.  
I have went with the same combination for my first ever website as it was a one page scrolling site too and the fonts looked so good on the screen. 
The fonts are [Titillium Web](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web) for the main text and [Roboto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Serif) for titles and section headings.


#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require.
I'm really not sure at this present time what icons will be used but deffo social media, email, phone and any other standard website icons will be used.
Other than that, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.

#### Colours

I have used the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website to come up with my colour scheme for this project and I love this wee website, as it has amazing combinations
already there for developers to utilise them.
I used [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to select the exact colours that is used for the main club badge so I can use them throughout the site. 
The only one I am a little wary off is the Yellow Orange as it may not look too good on a webpage but I will see how it goes and if needs be, I will tweak it a little to make it work.

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....

So a better breakdown of the colours are shown below:

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***White***           |#FFFFFF    |White              |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Cyan Process***    |#26a9e0    |Sky Blue           |Body background                 |
|***Yellow Orange***   |#faaf3f    |Light Orange       |Body background                 |
|***Black***           |#000000    |Black              |Body background, text & titles  |



## **Wireframes**

The software that I used for my wireframes was Balsamiq. This was the fifth time I used this software and I really enjoy designing my project layouts using this. The software allows you design the basic layout of your website on devices such as a desktop, tablet and mobile. They are just simple 2D sketches but I now understand how important these really are :) 
I think my wireframes look good and deffo give me a great starting point for the design process !

Anyway, you can have a wee look at my wireframes below:

## **Testing**

### Ease Of Use

#### User Story : I want to enjoy a aesthetically pleasing website which is easy to navigate around

* **Plan**  
Although this website was going to be fairly simple, I still wanted to create a uniqueness and eye catching experience within each section. 
I wanted each section to be just high enough for the screen and the scrolling behaviour to be smooth.

* **Implementation**  
I extracted the main colours of the site from the club crest at the start of the project so I have tried my best to utilise these throughout the website which I think adds continunity. The navbar link hover colour is the crest blue, as is the social links and send button in the contact section which also change colour to the yellow orange when hovered over. The Hero welcome text has blue and white, the background has a yellow orange border which is also from the clubs crest (the wee towers). I also faded the background from white to blue in the Sponsors section too.

* **Test**   
As the website progressed I could see that making small changes to use the same colours worked well and kept unity. The smooth scrolling works well in Chrome, Firefox, Edge but it doesn't work in Safari .... it just jumps instantly to the selected section but it still looks and works well.
I also had a fixed background for the training section which worked really well across all platforms even Safari but it wouldn't work on Ios. On an Iphone the Training section  background was a zoomed in section of the image so was all pixelated and looked awful. That's why I was gutted as it looked so good on the rest of the devices, with the cards scrolling on past the fixed background but in the end there was no real easy fix so I just removed the ```background-attachment: fixed;```.
All links work well and navigate the user to the chosen section of the website. The Sponsor links and the Contact social links all work well. 

* **Result**  
Overall, fairly happy with the small aesthetic adjustments. I was annoyed at the Training background issue but I still think it works well.

* **Verdict**
Very happy with the overall look of the website. It displays the basic info and meets the requirements that was asked for, at the start of the project.



### What's It All About?

#### User Story : As a user I want to be able to visit the website and see what the football club is all about

* **Plan**  
The plan was simple .... add an About section giving a simple overview of the club.

* **Implementation**  
I asked Mark for some information about the club and he gave me a snippet from the Clubs Handbook. 
The hero image welcoming message was also at the start of the information he gave me.
I split the information up and added the welcome note to the Hero image just to add a little special touch on arrival.
The rest of the information is displayed on the left hand side of x-large screens whilst the Clubs Crest is displayed on the right.
As the screen gets smaller the clubs information moves on top of the clubs crest for large screens and when it gets to small tablet and mobile sizes, I remove the clubs crest altogether.
I added the Clubs Crest for larger screens because with just the information text, it looked boring and empty.
It is a faded background of White to Sky Blue, as this would have a connection to the clubs kit colours as well. I didn't want to use the Clubs Crest blue here as the Crest is on display.

* **Test**   
I think this section works well and the information gets displayed as required. The Clubs Crest disappears on small tablet and mobile screens displaying just the information which works well. I reduce the font size as the screens get smaller to. I change the fade from 'left to right' to 'top to bottom' on small tablets and mobile screens because it looks much better.

* **Result**
Overall, I am pleasantly pleased with the overall outcome and visual appearance. All we required was a little bit about the club to be there for a potential player to know about the club. Responsiveness works well too.

* **Verdict**
Simple section which works well and tells the user a little bit about the club.

### **Validation Checks**

All my HTML passed all the checks at [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) with only a few errors which were related to having p elements inside a span for my hero page welcome text and one warning because I wasn't using a header in my hero section.  
Below is my code before validation alerted me to the issues.

Below is all the errors my HTML validation threw up.

I then did a few code changes to eliminate these errors. Below is my code after I fixed the validation issues.

All my CSS passed all checks at [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no major errors and only a few warnings, which were all to do with **webkits** issues.

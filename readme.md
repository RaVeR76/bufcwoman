## **Goal for this project**

The main aim for this project is to display some information and contact details for my own towns local womans football team - **Ballymena United FC Woman**.
The website will be fairly simple where users can visit for relevant information associated with the club. 
This is all that is required at present and will possibly evolve in the future, depending on requirements.

This is my first solo project after completing my studies so I want to develop this website to the best of my ability.
I want to make my home town womans football team proud and encourage the girls or women of all ages to sign up, develop their skills and most importantly .... play some football !!!

I hope you enjoy this project :)
